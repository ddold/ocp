     *       Static
     *     ----------
     * - Static members (fields and methods) are common to all instances of a class
     *   and aren't unique to any instance of a class
     * - Static members exist independently of any instances of a class and may be
     *   accessed even when no instances of the class have been created
     * - Static members are known as class fields or class methods because they belong
     *   to the class and not to the instance of the class
     * - A static variable/method can be accessed using the name of an object reference
     *   variable or the name of a class
     * - A static method/variable can't access nonstatic methods/variables of a class
     *   But the reverse works - nonstatic methods/variables can access static variables/methods
     * - Static classes and interfaces are a type of nested classes and interfaces
     * - You can't prefix the definition of a top-level class or an interface with the keyword
     *   static. A top-level class or interface is one that isn't defined within
     *   another class or interface
