     * - The DAO pattern encapsulates all communication with a persistent store to access and manipulate
     *   and stored data
     * - The DAO pattern also manages the connection to the data store to retrieve and store the data
     * - An application usually defines separate DAO classes for each type of data object that should
     *   be persisted
     * - The CRUD operations form the basis of the DAO pattern
     * - The DAO pattern removes the direct dependency between an application and the data persistence
     *   implementations
     * - The DAO pattern is frequently used with the Factory pattern
